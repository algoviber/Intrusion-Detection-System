# Intrusion-Detection-System

This repository implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model leverages GANs to generate synthetic data, aiding in the identification and classification of network intrusions.

# Dataset
The project uses the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection systems.

The dataset contains features like protocol type, service, flag, and traffic metrics.
A subset of the dataset (target == 0) is selected for training the GAN to generate synthetic normal traffic data.
Dataset Preparation:
Download the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
Place the files in a data/ directory within the repository.
The notebook includes preprocessing steps to format the data for model training.
GAN Model
The GAN consists of:

# Generator:

A neural network with dense layers, batch normalization, and Leaky ReLU activation.
Input: Noise vector.
Output: Synthetic data samples mimicking normal network traffic.
Example snippet:

python
Copy code
def make_generator_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Dense(16, input_shape=(100,)))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    # Additional layers
    return model

    
# Discriminator:

A neural network distinguishing real traffic data from GAN-generated samples.
Output: Probability of the sample being real.
# Loss Functions:

Cross-entropy loss for both the generator and discriminator.
# Optimization:

Both networks use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4.
# Training Workflow:
Train the generator to produce realistic samples that fool the discriminator.
Train the discriminator to differentiate real samples from synthetic ones.
# Results
Performance metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports are used to evaluate the IDS.
The generated synthetic data enhances the model's ability to detect intrusions.
